"This function provides an interactive match of available products (and product combinations) to a customer based on customer type/characteristics, the context for the request and desired product/service features. The matching mechanism can prompt for additional details as may be necessary to select a product and/or confirm the eligibility of the customer. The facility can also consider broader factors such as business preferences/strategy and prevailing business/market conditions when selecting products. Product Matching references the Customer Product/Service Eligibility service domain where the customer's use and eligibility to the bank's full range of products and services is maintained in order to limit the matching to only those products for which the customer is entitled and not already using"
